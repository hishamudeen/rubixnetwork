# Rubix - ProofChain

A deterministic state-machine that is designed to address the scale, cost, and privacy shortcomings of blockchain protocols that rely on one sequentially organized chain of all global transactions. The global state-machine is divided into finite number of state-machines called ProofChains. While each ProofChain maintains one state, together all ProofChains represent a globally accessible singleton state that is immutable. 

# Features

* Instant Confirmation and Finality of Transaction
* Light-Weight Proof of Work (LWPOW)
* Asynchronous Parallelism
* Double Spending and Fork Resolution
* Pre-Mined Tokens
* Non-Linear Secret Sharing (NLSS)
